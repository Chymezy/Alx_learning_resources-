------------

    Switch Statement: Designed for fixed values or patterns, not conditions.
    If Statement: Better suited for conditions and ranges.

In summary, use if statements for conditions and ranges, and switch statements for fixed values or patterns. This will help you decide when to use each construct appropriately in your code.
