            <p>It is with great pleasure that I recommend Joshua Benjamin for MSc. In Computer and Data Engineering. I 
knew Joshua professionally through his work as one of my subordinate in Nigerian Foundries Limited – a 
major cast producer in West Africa that majors in reverse engineering. Joshua is one of the best worker I
have had the pleasure of working with over the past few years.
He is extremely smart and thinks well. He is motivated to put in long hours in his work just to keep the job 
running and smoothly. He is truly curious and innovative. He is good in the area of coding, data analytics, 
energy systems and computer maintenance. He always takes his time while executing project assigned to 
him. He also works well with others on a team</p>
