My name is Joshua Benjamin 
I am from Imo state Nigeria
I studied Electrical Engineering but 
I majored in electronics engineering
I have worked in the industry as an engineer
I've had the first class experience of engineering struggle in Nigeria
I decided to switch to sustainability through energy management 
Carbon emission reduction by Nigerian Industries
I got trained by German & and European government as energy auditor]
I practiced this for one year at Nigerian foundries Limited 
I got them the recoginition the required and thus the became the first foundries to be energy compliant
I had many challenges growing in this regard as it has to do with human behavior change to energy use
implementation of energy efficient equipment which involues money. 
I automatically became the enemy of so many including the CEO's of the company.
I was set-up number of times but I previal in all my doings and now I am doing fuckingly well.
Grit made to leave the company without option of job. I became jobless for 6 months and I started doing business
It became evident dreams are not coming through and life is hard. Little did I know that great men are those who
do HARD THINGS always. My name is Joshua Benjamin
