Abstract Base Classes

What It Is:

    JavaScript doesn't have built-in abstract classes, but you can create them by throwing errors in the base class to prevent it from being instantiated directly.

How to Use:

    Define a base class and throw an error in its constructor.
    Extend the base class to create subclasses.
