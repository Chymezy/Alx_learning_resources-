Class Definition

What It Is:

    A class is like a blueprint for creating objects (like how a blueprint of a house guides the construction of many houses).
    In JavaScript, you define a class using the class keyword.

How to Use:

    Use the class keyword to start the class definition.
    Use a constructor method to initialize the object's properties when you create an instance of the class.
