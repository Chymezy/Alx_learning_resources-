Arithmetic Operators: this operators perform basic arithematic operation:
a) addition(+) b) subtravtion(-) c) Multiplication(*) d) division(/) e) modulus(%)


Comparism Operators: these operators compare two values and return boolean result (true or false):
a) == b) != c) > d) < e) >= f) <=

Logical Operators: These operators areused to combine conditional statements:
a) && b) || c) !

Bitwise Operator: These operators perform bit-level operations:
Bitwise AND (&): Performs a bitwise AND operation.
Bitwise OR (|): Performs a bitwise OR operation.
Bitwise XOR (^): Performs a bitwise exclusive OR operation.
Bitwise NOT (~): Performs a bitwise NOT operation.
Left shift (<<): Shifts bits to the left.
Right shift (>>): Shifts bits to the right.

Other Operators

    Conditional (ternary) operator (?:): Returns one of two values depending on the value of a Boolean expression. condition ? resultIfTrue : resultIfFalse

    Null-coalescing operator (??): Returns the left-hand operand if it is not null; otherwise, it returns the right-hand operand.
    Null-conditional operator (?. or ?[]): Used to perform member access or element access operations only if the operand is not null.
