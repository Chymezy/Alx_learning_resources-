What is Typed-Array?
Typed array is simply a specialized array that stores objects of a specific 
type in memory buffer. This used to write or read raw binary data into buffer memory

Buffer: is a small chuck of object that holds object binary data in memory.
we have two types of buffers: 
1. ArrayBuffer: A simple buffer for raw binary data.
2. SharedArrayBuffer: A buffer that can be accessed by multiple execution contexts, 
suitable for use in multithreaded environments.

Views:
Views provide a context for accessing data in a buffer. There are two main 
kinds of views:

1. Typed array views: These provide a specific data type and offer methods similar to standard arrays, 
    like Int8Array, Uint32Array, Float64Array, etc.
2. DataView: Offers low-level control over buffer data, allowing for reading and writing data with different formats.

Typed Array Characteristics
-------------------------------
    1. Typed arrays cannot be resized directly; they are fixed-length.
    2. Methods like push, pop, splice, etc., are unavailable for typed arrays.
    3. Typed arrays have methods like set and subarray for efficient data manipulation.
