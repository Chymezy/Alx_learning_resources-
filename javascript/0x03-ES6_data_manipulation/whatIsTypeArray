What is Typed-Array?
Typed array is simply a specialized array that stores objects of a specific 
type in memory buffer. This used to write or read raw binary data into buffer memory

BUFFERS: 
----------
is a small chuck of object that holds object binary data in memory.
There are two types of buffers: ArrayBuffer and SharedArrayBuffer. Both are low-level representations of a memory span. They have "array" in their names, but they don't have much to do with arrays â€” you cannot read or write to them directly. Instead, buffers are generic objects that just contain raw data. In order to access the memory represented by a buffer, you need to use a view.
we have two types of buffers: 
1. ArrayBuffer: A simple buffer for raw binary data.
2. SharedArrayBuffer: A buffer that can be accessed by multiple execution contexts, 
suitable for use in multithreaded environments.

Buffers supports the following actions:
1. Allocate: as soon as a new buffer is created, a new buffer is allocated and initized to 0.
2. Copy: using slice() method, we can copy portions of buffer without creating views.
3. Transfer: using transfer() and transferToFixedLength() methods, we can transfer the buffer memory span ownership to new buffer object. note a sharedArrayBuffer can not be transferred bcos is alread shared by all execution context.
4. Resize: using the resize() method we can the memory span. note sharedArrayBuffer can only grow not shrunck.

Views:
Views provide a context for accessing data in a buffer. There are two main 
kinds of views:

1. Typed array views: These provide a specific data type and offer methods similar to standard arrays, 
    like Int8Array, Uint32Array, Float64Array, etc.
2. DataView: Offers low-level control over buffer data, allowing for reading and writing data with different formats.

Typed Array Characteristics
-------------------------------
    1. Typed arrays cannot be resized directly; they are fixed-length.
    2. Methods like push, pop, splice, etc., are unavailable for typed arrays.
    3. Typed arrays have methods like set and subarray for efficient data manipulation.
