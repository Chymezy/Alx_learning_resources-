Inheritance

What It Is:

    Inheritance allows a class to inherit properties and methods from another class.
    The extends keyword is used to create a subclass (child class) from a superclass (parent class).

How to Use:

    Use extends to create a subclass.
    Use super() to call the parent class's constructor inside the subclass's constructor.
